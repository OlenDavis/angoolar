	# This allows us to easily separate different implementations of similar objects based on domain.
	# For instance, two directives that communicate with an API and are identical aside from *which*
	# API they communicate with could be differentiated hilariously simply by having the second extend
	# the first, overriding its API angoolar path (I'm assuming it's declared prototypally) and overriding
	# its _prefix with something else - this way, you can actually refer to them both in markup
	# by identical names different only in a prefix that should be indicative of the difference.
