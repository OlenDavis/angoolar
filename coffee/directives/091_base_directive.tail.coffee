# about name collision with other controllers on the angoolar scope).

"put") the directive's inner text into its template, make this true and put the directive, "ng-transclude" on the element you want to receive this directive's inner text
	restrict   : null # by default, this is 'A' for attribute, but can also be 'E' for elements this isn't the Angular default (which is 'A' for attribute) but we will usually use directives for elements (there is also 'M' for comment/meta directives)

	notIsolated: null # This determines whether to treat this directive's scope as isolated or not; if not, then the directive's scope will simply be a child of its parent's scope.

	# Use these to specify default values for isolated scope attributes by specifying an object whose keys are the isolate
	# scope attribute names (as given on the scope member), and whose values will define the scope attribute whenever it
	# changes to something undefined (according to angular.isDefined). You can declare the default value one of two ways:
	scopeDefaults          : {} # values are just strings or objects or whatever, and will be set to the scope attribute whenever it is undefined (according to angular.isDefined)
	scopeDefaultExpressions: {} # values are only strings that will be evaluated as angular expressions in the directive's current scope to get the value of the scope attribute whenever it is undefined (according to angular.isDefined)
	# NOTE: when declaring the same key in scopeDefaults and scopeDefaultExpressions, behavior, while not undefined, shouldn't be depended on; the scopeDefaultExpressions watchers will be attached before the watchers for the scopeDefaults, however given the fact that the order of watcher listeners' firing may or may not change, the fact that scopeDefaultExpressions generally have precedence over scopeDefaults, that is really an assumption that's not to be relied upon

	# This allows us to not only set the template directory on a site-by-site basis, but to actually
